# Biocryptor-main-1 :  Secure Access Control Digital Evidence Using Biometric-Enhanced Attribute-Based Encryption

## ðŸ“š Research Paper â€” NetCrypt IEEE 3rd International Conference 2025

## ðŸ”¹ Project Description ðŸ”¹
This project aims to enhance the credibility and traceability of digital evidence by employing biometric authentication and attribute-based encryption alongside blockchain technology.
The system utilizes AES for data confidentiality, SHA-256 for data integrity, and smart contracts to enable fine-grained, policy-controlled access.
It guarantees secure, tamper-proof storage and controlled access for digital forensic materials.


## ðŸ”¹ Features ðŸ”¹
Biometric Authentication â€” restricts access to authorized users

Encryption (AES) â€” guarantees confidentiality of sensitive data

Hashing (SHA-256) â€” prevents tampering and maintains data integrity

Smart Contracts (Ethereum) â€” policy-controlled authorization mechanisms

Web Application (React) â€” convenient UI for accessing and verifying digital evidence

Web3 Integration â€” interaction between smart contracts and the React application
